# Technical Stack - AYA Vision Flare Detection Demo

This document describes the technical implementation details for the AYA Vision Detection Demo application.

## 1. Technology Overview

### Frontend
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Core web technologies using modern ES6+ features
- **Bootstrap 5**: For responsive layout and UI components
- **Font Awesome**: For icons and visual indicators
- **Custom JavaScript**: For interactive features and AJAX requests
- **Session Storage**: For persisting user preferences

### Backend
- **Python Flask**: Web framework with modular architecture
- **Cohere Python SDK**: For interacting with the c4ai-aya-vision-32b model
- **Flask Blueprints**: For route organization
- **WTForms**: For form validation and rendering

## 2. Technical Implementation

### Frontend Implementation
- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) for all client-side interactions
- Implement progress tracking using XMLHttpRequest for upload monitoring
- Use fetch API for polling analysis progress
- Direct DOM manipulation for performance-critical operations like filtering
- Implement modal dialogs using Bootstrap's modal component
- Handle form submissions with AJAX to prevent page reloads
- Use session storage for maintaining state between page loads
- Implement responsive design with Bootstrap grid system

### Backend Implementation
- Modular Flask application using Blueprints for code organization
- Base64 encoding for image processing (required for the Cohere API)
- In-memory progress tracking system with unique IDs for each batch of images
- Progress callback mechanism for image processing functions
- RESTful API endpoints for image analysis, deletion, and progress tracking
- Progress tracking API endpoint (`/api/analysis-progress/<progress_id>`) for retrieving real-time status
- Backend polling mechanism to handle long-running processes

### API Interaction
- Cohere Python SDK for reliable API calls
- Asynchronous processing to prevent blocking the main thread during batch operations
- Implement retry logic (with exponential backoff) for transient errors
- Log all API interactions (requests and responses) for debugging and analysis
- Handle rate limiting and API errors gracefully

### Data Flow
1. Frontend captures and validates user input
2. Images are converted to Base64 on the client-side before upload
3. Backend receives uploaded images and stores them in memory
4. API requests are made to Cohere's c4ai-aya-vision-32b model
5. Results are stored in-memory and returned to the client
6. Frontend polls for progress updates during long-running operations
7. Frontend renders results using dynamic HTML generation

### Data Storage
- In-memory storage for image analysis results (both initial and enhanced)
- In-memory storage for progress tracking information with unique progress IDs
- Persistent storage (using Flask's session or a simple file-based solution) for user settings
- No database is required for the MVP, but can be added in future iterations

## 3. Deployment Considerations

### Development Environment
- Local development using Flask's built-in development server
- Environment variables for configuration and secret management
- Virtual environment for Python dependency isolation

### Production Deployment
- Gunicorn/uWSGI as WSGI servers for production
- Containerization (Docker) for easier deployment and portability
- Environment variable configuration for sensitive data
- Potential cloud platforms: AWS, GCP, Azure
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

## 4. Performance Optimization
- Client-side filtering and sorting to minimize server load
- Efficient image encoding and processing
- Pagination for large result sets
- Asynchronous loading of images and results
- Optimized progress tracking with minimal overhead

## 5. Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test individual functions (e.g., Base64 encoding, API interaction, response parsing)
- Test utility functions for image processing and data handling
- Test form validation and error handling

### Integration Tests
- Test the flow from image upload to result display
- Test filtering and sorting functionality
- Test enhanced analysis workflow
- Test settings configuration and persistence

### Load Testing
- Test with varying numbers of images to determine performance limits
- Identify bottlenecks in the processing pipeline
- Optimize based on performance testing results

## 6. Future Technical Enhancements

### Scalability
- Implement a task queue (e.g., Celery) for asynchronous image processing
- Consider database storage for persistent results (SQLAlchemy with SQLite/PostgreSQL)
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data

### Security
- Implement CSRF protection for all forms
- Add rate limiting for API endpoints
- Implement content security policy
- Add input sanitization for all user-provided data

### Enhanced UI/UX
- Add animations for state transitions
- Implement drag-and-drop file upload with preview
- Add keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Improve accessibility features
